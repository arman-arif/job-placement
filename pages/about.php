                                Job placement is a service that educational institutions, employment agencies and recruiters offer to help individuals find work. Examples of placement programs include a university helping students find internships and practice interviewing, an employment agency offering vocational counseling and job leads to job seekers, and the military helping prepare soldiers for suitable careers during and after their service.
